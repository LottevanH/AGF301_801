# AGF301_801
Scripts for AGF301_801 incl silver bullet calibration

Raphael Deirmendjian created the calibration script for the silverbullet spectrometer located at the Kjell Henriksen Observatory in Longyearbyen, Svalbard in 2022. 
It can be found on Github: https://github.com/Rafale05/Silver-Bullet-calibration
An accompanying video with additional information on the instrument and the calibration process can be found here: https://youtu.be/WP0HZCWyedU 

The goal of the calibration script is to easily assess the quality of the yearly calibration performed by students of the AGF-301/801 course of the University Centre in Svalbard (more information: https://www.unis.no/courses/agf-301-the-upper-polar-atmosphere/).

The necessary calibration files can be found in the "calibration_files" folder (both wavelength and absolute calibration).

This binder is set up for the fieldwork of AGF-301/801 by Charlotte M van Hazendonk
